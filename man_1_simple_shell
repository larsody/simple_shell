.SH DESCRIPTION
This shell is a project dedicated to our studies. My partner and I, have tried to mimic the behavior of a real shell. In case you don't know what a shell is (I doubt that) here is a brief explanation. A shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Our shell does not support the arguments passed to it, yet. We are still working on it.
